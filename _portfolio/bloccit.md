## Explanation
Bloccit is a Reddit replica to practice Rails development as my very first Rail application.


## Problem
This is the first Rails project I build with my mentor at [Bloc. link](https://www.bloc.io/)
Everything was new to me from learning git, heroku, MVC concept framework, installing different Ruby programs and library gems, studying javascript, css, jQuery, and implementing Rspec test programs. 


## Solution

I have struggled every concept I have encountered even simply by following the Bloc's instructions step by step. However, as I apply the guided codes on my Rail application, eventually my application acts as supposeded and the framework's MVC concepts makes sense to me more and more. The best thing is that my mentor really helped me move onto the next challenges once I get stuck.

## Results

Althought Bloccit is my first project I created, I have learned so much and understood how Ruby on Rails ease web developers to achieve to put many complicated programing together to work on one single website neatly as long as the Rail convention is implemented correctly.


## Conclusion

I can always go back and refer to Bloccit when I need to recall the basic introductory application with a lots of useful concepts in the application to carry into the future projects.
